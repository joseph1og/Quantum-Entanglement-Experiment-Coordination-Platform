- Precise time-based experiment scheduling and alignment
- Real-time experimental parameter sharing and validation

### 📊 Blockchain-Verified Results
- Immutable, cryptographically secured experimental data storage
- Tamper-evident result verification mechanisms
- Transparent provenance tracking for quantum phenomena observations

### 💡 Incentive Mechanisms
- Native quantum research token ($QBIT)
- Tokenized rewards for:
    - Successful entanglement experiments
    - Breakthrough discoveries
    - Peer validation contributions
    - Novel experimental designs

### 🔍 Decentralized Peer Review
- Distributed expert validation network
- Reputation-based review scoring
- Transparent, stake-based evaluation processes

### 🚀 Quantum Technology Marketplace
- Platform for quantum entanglement-based application listings
- Smart contract-powered technology exchange
- Licensing and intellectual property management
